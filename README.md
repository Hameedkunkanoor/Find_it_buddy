 Suggestion for adding new blog :
 
 for writing new post use https://dev.to/new this ui to create new post for now.
 also suggest one example about how to write a new blog.
 
 
 Whenever the systemis offline the dev.to website is having canvas where we can draw anything 
 
Use a monkey which scrolls down as we scroll 
and on clicking it we will go up
